# How to run
We need 3 components to run this:

* A customed Z3 version (to dump the trace in the format the Backend expects)
[https://github.com/nhamlv-55/z3/tree/vis](https://github.com/nhamlv-55/z3/tree/vis)
* The Backend
[https://github.com/nhamlv-55/deepSpacer](https://github.com/nhamlv-55/deepSpacer)
* The Frontend (this repo)

## Setup and run the frontend
`./start_frontend.sh`

Running this script will serve the frontend at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) 

## Setup and run the backend
`./start_backend.sh`




## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.
