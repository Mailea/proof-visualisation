#  Saturation Visualization for Vampire

This tool visualizes Saturation Runs of Vampire, with the main aim to let a user **quickly** answer the following questions:
* Which consequences are derived?
  * Which of the consequences we anticipated were derived?
  * Which other interesting consequences were derived?
  * Which proof was found by Vampire?
* Why didn’t we derive a certain clause?
  * Forgot to add some trivial fact to the encoding
  * Ordering doesn’t allow inference
  * Weight is to big for clause to be selected
  * ...
